        <h3>Node JS</h3>
        <article>
          Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript run-time
          environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser.
          JavaScript is used primarily for client-side scripting, in which
          scripts written in JavaScript are embedded in a webpage's HTML and run
          client-side by a JavaScript engine in the user's web browser. Node.js
          lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for
          server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic
          web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
          Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere"
          paradigm,[7] unifying web application development around a single
          programming language, rather than different languages for server side
          and client side scripts. Though .js is the standard filename extension
          for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" does not refer to a particular
          file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js
          has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These
          design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web
          applications with many input/output operations, as well as for
          real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and
          browser games).[8] The Node.js distributed development project,
          governed by the Node.js Foundation,[9] is facilitated by the Linux
          Foundation's Collaborative Projects program.[10] Corporate users of
          Node.js software include GoDaddy,[11] Groupon,[12] IBM,[13]
          LinkedIn,[14][15] Microsoft,[16][17] Netflix,[18] PayPal,[19][20]

        <p>
          HTML 5 is the fifth and current major version of the HTML standard,
          and subsumes XHTML. It currently exists in two standardized forms:
          HTML 5.2 Recommendation[4] by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, a
          broad coalition of organizations), intended primarily for Web content
          developers; and HTML Living Standard[5] by WHATWG (a small consortium
          of four browser vendors), intended primarily for browser developers,
          though it also exists in an abridged Web developer version.[6] There
          are minor conflicts between the two groups' specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML 5 was first released in public-facing form on 22 January 2008,[7]
          with a major update and "W3C Recommendation" status in October
          2014.[2][8] Its goals are to improve the language with support for the
          latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both
          easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and
          devices such as Web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity;
          and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML 5 is
          intended to subsume not only HTML 4, but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2
          HTML;[9] the HTML 4 and XHTML specs were announced as superseded by
          HTML 5.2 on 27 March 2018.[10] HTML 5 includes detailed processing
          models to encourage more interoperable implementations; it extends,
          improves and rationalizes the markup available for documents, and
          introduces markup and application programming interfaces (APIs) for
          complex web applications.[11] For the same reasons, HTML 5 is also a
          candidate for cross-platform mobile applications, because it includes
          features designed with low-powered devices in mind.

      <h3>CSS</h3>
      <article>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
        describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        like HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web,
        alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2] CSS is designed to enable the
        separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
        fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility, provide
        more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation
        characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by
        specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce
        complexity and repetition in the structural content. Separation of
        formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup
        page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as
        on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for
        alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
        The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine
        which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a particular
        element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS
        specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
        Internet media type (MIME type) text/css is registered for use with CSS
        by RFC 2318 (March 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS validation service
        for CSS documents.[5] In addition to HTML, other markup languages
        support the use of CSS including XHTML, plain XML, SVG, and XUL.

      <h3>Javascript</h3>
      <article>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a
        high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the
        ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is
        characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and
        multi-paradigm. Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web.[9] JavaScript enables interactive
        web pages and is an essential part of web applications. The vast
        majority of websites use it,[10] and major web browsers have a dedicated
        JavaScript engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language,
        JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including
        object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has APIs for
        working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and the DOM, but
        the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking,
        storage, or graphics facilities. It relies upon the host environment in
        which it is embedded to provide these features.
