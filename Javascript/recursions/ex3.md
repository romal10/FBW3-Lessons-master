# Fibonacci numbers

The sequence of Fibonacci numbers has the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. In other words, the next number is a sum of the two preceding ones.

First two numbers are 1, then 2(1+1), then 3(1+2), 5(2+3) and so on: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21....

Fibonacci numbers are related to the Golden ratio and many natural phenomena around us.

Write a function fib(n) that returns the n-th Fibonacci number.

An example of work:

    function fib(n) { /* your code */ }

    alert(fib(3)); // 2
    alert(fib(7)); // 13
    alert(fib(77)); // 5527939700884757
