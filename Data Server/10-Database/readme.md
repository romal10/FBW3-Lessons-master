# Database (DB)
A database is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. Computer databases typically contain aggregations of data records or files  containing information about sales transactions or interactions with specific customers.

An online telephone Book would definitely use database to store data pertaining to people, phone numbers, other contact details, etc.

Your internet service provider is obviously using a database to manage billing , client related issues, to handle fault data, etc.

Let's also consider the facebook. It needs to store, manipulate and present data related to members, their friends, member activities, messages, advertisements and lot more.
We can provide countless number of examples for usage of databases .

## What is a Database Management System (DBMS)?
Database Management System (DBMS) is a collection of programs which enables its users to access database, manipulate data, reporting / representation of data .
It also helps to control access to the database.

Database Management Systems are not a new concept and as such had been first implemented in 1960s with hierarchical and network databases.
through the 1980s with object-oriented databases, and today with SQL and NoSQL databases and cloud databases.

## Types of DBMS
 -   **Hierarchical** - this type of DBMS employs the "parent-child" relationship of storing data. This type of DBMS is rarely used nowadays. Its structure is like a tree with nodes representing records and branches representing fields. The windows registry used in Windows XP is an example of a hierarchical database. Configuration settings are stored as tree structures with nodes.
 -   **Network DBMS** - this type of DBMS supports many-to many relations. This usually results in complex database structures. RDM Server is an example of a database management system that implements the network model.
 -   **Relational DBMS** - this type of DBMS defines database relationships in form of tables, also known as relations. Unlike network DBMS, RDBMS does not support many to many relationships.Relational DBMS usually have pre-defined data types that they can support. This is the most popular DBMS type in the market. Examples of relational database management systems include MySQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server database.
 -   **Object Oriented Relation DBMS** - this type supports storage of new data types. The data to be stored is in form of objects. The objects to be stored in the database have attributes (i.e. gender, ager) and methods that define what to do with the data. PostgreSQL is an example of an object oriented relational DBMS.
 

 - **Cloud database**

	A cloud database is a database that has been optimized or built for a virtualized environment, either in a hybrid cloud, public cloud or private cloud. Cloud databases provide benefits such as the ability to pay for storage capacity and bandwidth on a per-use basis, and they provide scalability on demand, along with high availability
	

 

- **NoSQL** 
databases are useful for large sets of distributed data.
NoSQL databases are effective for big data performance issues that relational databases aren't built to solve. They are most effective when an organization must analyze large chunks of unstructured data or data that's stored across multiple virtual servers  in the cloud.
